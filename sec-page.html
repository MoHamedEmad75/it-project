                <p>World cup is the most important football competition held under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The World Cup has been held every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were canceled due to World War II. The current format of the tournament, since 1998, features 32 national teams divided into eight groups, competing for the title for a full month in the host country's stadiums. These teams qualify for the tournament through a qualifying system held over three years.</p>
                <p>The Brazilian national team is the most crowned with the cup, having won it five times in the years: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002.</p>

                <p>UEFA Champions League is the most important club football tournament in the world.Prior to 1992, the tournament was officially called the European Champion Clubs' Cup, but is commonly referred to as the European Cup or the European Champions' Cup. Initially, it was a knockout tournament involving only the league champions of each country, along with the defending champions, who would then participate in the next edition to defend their title. The tournament began to expand in 1990, with the integration of a home-and-away group stage and an increase in the number of teams. In 1993, it was renamed the UEFA Champions League, and the number of teams increased to 32. The new Champions League began in the 1992–93 season.</p>
                <p>The title has been won by 23 different clubs, 13 of which have won it more than once. Real Madrid is the club with the most wins, having won the tournament 15 times.</p>
